# Project Title: [Implementing Lumped Model Oscillator LOM on a tunable coupler superconducting Qubits using Qiskit Metal]
## Description
Open quantum hardware refers to quantum computing systems and tools that are accessible to researchers, developers, and engineers for building, testing, and running quantum algorithms. These systems are often open-source or designed for collaborative research and innovation in quantum computing. Open quantum hardware accelerates the advancement of quantum computing by enabling precise design, visualization, and iterative improvements, which are crucial for overcoming challenges in building functional quantum devices. In this project, IBM's Qiskit Metal was used to handle the superconducting Qubits chip design. 

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and a research paper related to the hardware of superconducting Qubits, especially the connection between them using a tunable coupler. A presentation is also attached for brevity. The notebook includes a design for a tunable coupler using a Transformer implemented using Qiskit metal. The paper validates one of the advantages of the tunable coupler that was suggested by ... The results highlight the role that open quantum hardware (OQH) plays in advancing and accelerating the development and visualization of the field.
